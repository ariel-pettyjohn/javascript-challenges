# typescript-challenges
A collection of test-driven TypeScript challenges that I've compiled from across the web to keep myself sharp, and build a personal library of utility functions and algorithm implementations. Tests themselves are written in JavaScript. 

Some of these are based on implementations I've had lying around for a few weeks to a few years, which is why I've been able to test and implement so many functions so quickly at first. As the codebase grows and crystalizes then I expect development will slow down. I'll also go back periodically to add and audit test cases.

The code is deliberately academic, explicit, and terse for the sake of style; however, my style is very adaptable profesionally.
